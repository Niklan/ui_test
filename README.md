This module provide page with maximum UI elements for testing themes.

Created for testing [Glisseo](https://github.com/Niklan/Glisseo) base theme, but there is no dependency, most of features
are universal.

Inspired of demo content pages frameworks like Bootstrap, Semantic UI and others, this can help you testing many of
things in theme. You can easily edit plain HTML code for your purposes and your theme idea. This is just boilerplate
for HTML and CSS with some Drupal specific staff.
